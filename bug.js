This bug occurs when using the Expo `Image` component with a remote URI that returns a 404 error.  Instead of displaying a placeholder image or handling the error gracefully, the app crashes or shows a blank space. This is inconsistent with the expected behavior of handling image loading errors, where a user-defined placeholder image should be displayed or an error should be logged without affecting app stability.
